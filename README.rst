 Think Big, Git Big
====================

Large file storage with Git

``big`` extends git_ so it is able to handle large collections of
large files -- more than you'd have disk space for.

- only the files you request are available locally
- multiple copies are maintained for data integrity


``big`` is not like git-annex_, because

- it doesn't track the locations of the data files in the git
  repository
- it's not written in Haskell, so it might even work across
  distribution upgrades and platforms
- symlink destinations don't have to change when you move files from
  one directory to another
- it syncs over sftp, using Paramiko_

Much like git-annex_\ 's `"not" page
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/not/>`__ explains, ``big`` also
isn't

- a backup system (it does not keep history of the big files)
- filesystem (but you're free to fiddle with FUSE)
- not just a way to store large files; partial checkouts and replicas
  also matter a lot
- git-media_, because ``big`` does partial checkouts

``big`` exists because managing about 3TB of data with git-annex_
got too frustrating. We'll see if it's an actual improvement, or just
something fun to hack on.

How does ``big`` work?
======================

Well, it stores data. Let's say ``repo`` is your Git repository
(non-bare), you create a file ``jam.mp3`` with the SHA-1 of
``0123..23``, and run ``big add jam.mp3``. Then you'd have:

- symlink ``jam.mp3`` -> ``.big/01/23..23.data``, added to Git's index
- symlink ``.big`` -> ``.git/big``
- directory ``.git/big/``
- file ``.git/big/01/23..23.data``, with your mp3 in it

The files are managed like this:

- symlink ``jam.mp3``: commit to git
- symlink ``.big``: put in .gitignore, used only so symlink contents
  don't have to change
- directory ``.git/big``: outside of git history, managed with ``big``
  commands
